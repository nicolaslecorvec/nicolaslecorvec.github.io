	<h2>Crustal magma reorientation</h2>
  <p style="text-align:justify">While the geodynamic environment of magma reservoir highly influence the stability of magma reservoir and the propagation of magmas within the lithosphere, volcanic eruptions themselves can transform the local environment leading to changes in the state of stress within the crust (e.g., caldera formation [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2016GL068721" target="_blank">Corbi et al., 2016</a>]). These changes in the state of stress can promote the reorientation and the diversion of magmas allowing potential eruptions away from the original volcanic center [Lefebvre et al., 2012; Maccaferri et al., 2014; Maccaferri et al., 2017]. Observations at eroded monogenetic volcanic fields can provide tremendous information on the magmatic plumbing systems underlying these systems, specifically diversion of magmas from vertical to lateral propagation have been observed at the base of eroded diatreme structures [Muirhead et al., 2016]. These information can be used to decipher the eruptive mechanisms influencing magma propagation and magma diversion within the crust [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03865-x" target="_blank">Le Corvec et al., 2018</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2019.00084" target="_blank">Zorn et al., 2019</a>].
