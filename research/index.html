	<h2>Research Interests</h2>
	<p style="text-align:justify"> My main interest lies in the understanding of the physical and structural controls on magmato-volcano-tectonic systems, which cover the internal accumulation of magma within the lithosphere that leads to the formation of reservoirs; the mechanical stability of these reservoirs within their geodynamic environment which when reaching failure leads to the magma propagation within the lithosphere. The effect of the pre-existing stress state and structures on the propagation of these magmas and finally if an eruption occurs, the interaction between the magmatic intrusion and the volcanic edifice and with the eruption. To decipher these interactions, I, in collaboration with scientific experts from around the world, use a multivariate but complementary approach based on direct observations through fieldwork, structural mapping, and satellite imagery. These data subsequently serve as the foundation for theoretical modeling though analogue, numerical and statistical methods. My work is applied to a large array of geologic systems, from individual magma-filled fractures (such as dikes or sills) to fields of individual monogenetic volcanic centers to large polygenetic volcanoes. These systems can be either on Earth or other telluric bodies, such as Venus and Mars.
